These files are the assignments that were part of my Algorithms Course
1) C++ programming language has been used
2) Find a peak: In this problem peak element was needed to be found that wasn't smaller than it's neighbors
3) Closest Pair Problem-part1: The desired output was to find the closest points having distinct values on the coordinates and the distance between both points
4) Closest Pair Problem-part2: The desired output was to find the closest points having duplicate x-values on the coordinates and the distance between both points
5) Line Error problem: Compute line error from the given the points
